# SMS_spam-ham
Project README Summary: Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

This project involves creating a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend, while "spam" refers to an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
Instructions:

    Development Environment: Use Google Colaboratory to develop the model. You should make a copy of the notebook from the provided link and work on it.
    Objective: Develop a function called predict_message that takes a string (message) as input and returns a list:
        The first element should be a number between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of the message being "ham" (0) or "spam" (1).
        The second element should be the word "ham" or "spam", depending on the most likely classification.
    Data: You will use the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which is already split into training and test data.
    Code Structure:
        The first two cells import the necessary libraries and load the data.
        The last cell tests your model and function.
        You should insert your code in between these cells.

Requirements:

    Complete the project and ensure it passes the provided tests.
    If using Google Colaboratory, make sure to enable link sharing so that anyone with the link can access it.

This challenge will help you apply machine learning techniques and text processing for SMS message classification.
